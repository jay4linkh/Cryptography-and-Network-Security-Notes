Steps to Use S-Box 1

Step 1: Input Selection

Suppose we have a 6-bit input for the S-Box. The input will be split into two parts:

The first and last bits determine the row.
The middle four bits determine the column.
For example, letâ€™s use the 6-bit input: 101110.

Row: Formed by the first and last bits (1 and 0), which gives us binary 10 (decimal 2).
Column: Formed by the middle four bits (0111), which gives us binary 0111 (decimal 7).

Step 2: Locate the Value in the S-Box Table

Determine the Row and Column:
Row index: 2
Column index: 7
Find the Value in the S-Box Table:
In S-Box 1, at Row 2 and Column 7, the value is 1.

Step 3: Substitute the Value

The 6-bit input 101110 is substituted by the S-Box output value.

Numerical Example
Let's use a complete step-by-step numerical example for S-Box substitution.

1. Input Data:

6-bit input: 110101

2. Determine Row and Column:

Row: First and last bits of input (1 and 1), which gives us binary 11 (decimal 3).
Column: Middle four bits of input (1010), which gives us binary 1010 (decimal 10).

3. Lookup in S-Box Table:

For S-Box 1, Row 3 and Column 10:
S-Box 1 value at (Row 3, Column 10) is 11 in binary, which is 3 in decimal.

4. Result of Substitution:

The output from the S-Box for input 110101 is 0011 (binary) or 3 (decimal).

Extract Row and Column:
Row from the first and last bits of the 6-bit input.
Column from the middle four bits of the 6-bit input.

Substitute:
Find the corresponding value in the S-Box table based on the extracted row and column.

Output:
The value found in the S-Box table is the substituted output.

Using the S-Box in DES involves converting a 6-bit input into a row and column index, finding the corresponding value in the S-Box table, and using that value as the substituted output. This non-linear substitution process introduces confusion into the encryption algorithm, enhancing its security.
