A substitution cipher is a type of encryption where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter according to a fixed system. This is one of the simplest and oldest forms of encryption used to obscure information.

Types of Substitution Ciphers

1. Caesar Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

Example

Let's use a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 positions.

Key: Shift each letter by 3 positions (A → D, B → E, C → F, etc.)
Plaintext: HELLO

Substitution Process:

H → K
E → H
L → O
L → O
O → R
Ciphertext: KHOOR

2. Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher
In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter with a fixed relationship. The relationship does not change throughout the message.

Example

Let's use a simple substitution where each letter of the alphabet is shifted by 4 positions.

Key: Shift each letter by 4 positions (A → E, B → F, C → G, etc.)
Plaintext: MEET ME AT THE PARK

Substitution Process:

M → Q
E → I
E → I
T → X
(Space remains unchanged)
M → Q
E → I
(Space remains unchanged)
A → E
T → X
(Space remains unchanged)
T → X
H → L
E → I
(Space remains unchanged)
P → T
A → E
R → V
K → O
Ciphertext: QIIX QI EX XLI TEVO

3. Polyalphabetic Substitution Cipher
In a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, the substitution rules change throughout the message. This is achieved by using multiple substitution alphabets.

Example (Vigenère Cipher)

The Vigenère cipher uses a keyword to determine the shifting for each letter in the plaintext.

Keyword: KEY
Plaintext: HELLO
Keyword Repeated: KEYKE

Substitution Process:

Convert letters to their numerical positions (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
H (7), E (4), L (11), L (11), O (14)
K (10), E (4), Y (24), K (10), E (4)
Add the numerical positions of the plaintext and keyword letters, modulo 26:
(7 + 10) % 26 = 17 → R
(4 + 4) % 26 = 8 → I
(11 + 24) % 26 = 9 → J
(11 + 10) % 26 = 21 → V
(14 + 4) % 26 = 18 → S
Ciphertext: RIJVS

Numerical Examples

1. Caesar Cipher Example
Key: Shift of 5 positions (A → F, B → G, etc.)

Plaintext: HELLO WORLD

Substitution Process:

H → M
E → J
L → Q
L → Q
O → T
(Space remains unchanged)
W → B
O → T
R → W
L → Q
D → I
Ciphertext: MJQQT BTWQI

2. Monoalphabetic Cipher Example
Key: Shift of 6 positions (A → G, B → H, etc.)

Plaintext: MEET ME AT THE PARK

Substitution Process:

M → S
E → K
E → K
T → Z
(Space remains unchanged)
M → S
E → K
(Space remains unchanged)
A → G
T → Z
(Space remains unchanged)
T → Z
H → N
E → K
(Space remains unchanged)
P → V
A → G
R → X
K → Q
Ciphertext: SKKZ SK GZ ZNK VGXQ

3. Polyalphabetic Cipher Example
Keyword: BOOK

Plaintext: DATA

Keyword Repeated: BOOK

Substitution Process:

Convert letters to their numerical positions (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
D (3), A (0), T (19), A (0)
B (1), O (14), O (14), K (10)
Add the numerical positions of the plaintext and keyword letters, modulo 26:
(3 + 1) % 26 = 4 → E
(0 + 14) % 26 = 14 → O
(19 + 14) % 26 = 7 → H
(0 + 10) % 26 = 10 → K
Ciphertext: EOHK

Advantages and Disadvantages

Advantages
  Simplicity: Easy to implement and understand.
  Fast Encryption/Decryption: Computationally efficient due to the simple substitution.
  Disadvantages
  Vulnerability: Susceptible to frequency analysis and pattern recognition, especially in monoalphabetic ciphers.
  Predictable Patterns: The fixed substitution can reveal patterns in the ciphertext.

Conclusion

Substitution ciphers, including Caesar and Vigenère ciphers, provide a basic understanding of cryptographic techniques. While they offer foundational knowledge, modern encryption methods have evolved to address their limitations.
