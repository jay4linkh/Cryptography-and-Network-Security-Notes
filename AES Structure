1. Introduction to AES:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric key encryption algorithm used to secure data.
It was adopted by the U.S. government in 2001 and is widely used across various applications.
AES operates on a block size of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.

2. Key Components of AES:

Plaintext: The original message or data to be encrypted.
Ciphertext: The encrypted output after applying the AES algorithm.
Key: A sequence of bits used to perform both encryption and decryption. The key size can be 128, 192, or 256 bits.

3. Structure of AES:
AES encryption involves multiple rounds, and the number of rounds depends on the key size:

10 rounds for a 128-bit key.
12 rounds for a 192-bit key.
14 rounds for a 256-bit key.

Each round consists of several specific steps, except the final round, which omits one step (MixColumns).

4. AES Rounds Overview:
4.1 Initial Round:

  AddRoundKey: XOR the state with the first round key.

4.2 Main Rounds:
  Each round consists of four transformations:
  SubBytes:
    A non-linear substitution step where each byte in the state array is replaced with another byte according to an S-Box.
    The S-Box is a 16x16 lookup table used to provide non-linearity in the cipher.
ShiftRows:
    A transposition step where each row of the state is cyclically shifted a certain number of steps to the left.
    The first row is unchanged, the second row is shifted by one byte, the third row by two bytes, and the fourth row by three bytes.
MixColumns:
    A mixing operation that operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column.
    Each column is multiplied by a fixed polynomial in GF(2^8) and is essential for ensuring diffusion.
    Note: This step is omitted in the final round.
AddRoundKey:
    The state is XORed with a round key derived from the original encryption key.
    The round keys are generated during the key expansion phase.

4.3 Final Round:
  The final round consists of only three steps:
  SubBytes
  ShiftRows
  AddRoundKey (No MixColumns)

5. Key Expansion:
  Purpose: To generate a series of round keys from the original key.
  Process:
  The original key undergoes an expansion process to produce a key schedule.
  Each round key is generated from the previous one using a combination of:
    RotWord: Rotates the bytes in a word.
    SubWord: Applies the S-Box substitution to each byte.
    Rcon: XOR with a round constant derived from the field GF(2^8).

6. AES Decryption:
    The decryption process reverses the encryption steps using the same round keys in reverse order.
    The decryption operations are:
      Inverse ShiftRows
      Inverse SubBytes (uses the inverse S-Box)
      AddRoundKey
      Inverse MixColumns (omitted in the final round)

7. Security Considerations:
    AES is considered secure against known cryptographic attacks.
    The number of rounds, key length, and the complexity of the operations (especially SubBytes and MixColumns) provide strong security guarantees.

8. Applications of AES:
    Widely used in secure communication protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS, VPNs).
    Implemented in hardware and software for encrypting sensitive data.
    Used in various standards, including wireless security (WPA2), file encryption, and more.

Conclusion:
AES is a robust encryption standard that offers strong security through a well-defined structure involving multiple rounds of substitutions, permutations, and key mixing. Its widespread adoption makes it a critical component of modern cryptographic systems.
