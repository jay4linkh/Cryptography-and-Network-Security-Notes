1. Confusion

Confusion refers to the property that the relationship between the plaintext (input) and the ciphertext (output) should be as complex as possible. In simpler terms, it means that a small change in the plaintext or the key should result in a significant and seemingly random change in the ciphertext. This helps to obscure the relationship between the key and the ciphertext, making it harder for attackers to deduce the key.

How it Works in DES:
Confusion in DES is achieved primarily through the use of the substitution process in each round. This is accomplished via the S-boxes (Substitution boxes) that perform non-linear transformations on the input data.

Example:
Initial Setup:
  Plaintext block: 10101100 11010011 00101101 10001011 (in binary)
  Key: 10101101 01011011 00101110 11010101 10010110 01010011 11010110 10001101 (56-bit key derived from 64-bit original key by dropping parity bits)
Encryption Steps:
  DES applies the key through a series of permutations and substitutions. For simplicity, let's say we're analyzing one round of DES.
S-Box Example:
  Suppose the output from the expansion permutation and XOR with the subkey results in a 48-bit input for the S-boxes.
  After substitution, this 48-bit input is transformed into a 32-bit output.
Confusion Demonstration:
  If you change a single bit in the original key or plaintext, the output after the S-box substitution will be vastly different due to the non-linear nature of the S-boxes.

2. Diffusion

Diffusion refers to the property that the influence of a single plaintext bit should be spread over many ciphertext bits. This means that changes to a small part of the plaintext or key should affect many parts of the ciphertext, ensuring that patterns in the plaintext are dispersed throughout the ciphertext.

How it Works in DES:
Diffusion in DES is achieved through the permutation processes, including the initial permutation (IP), the round permutations, and the final permutation (FP). The swapping of data and mixing performed in each round ensures that each bit of the plaintext influences multiple bits of the ciphertext.

Example:

Initial Setup:
  Consider the same plaintext block as before.
Diffusion Steps:
  The plaintext is permuted using the initial permutation (IP).
  In each DES round, the data is split into two halves (L and R). The right half undergoes expansion, substitution, and permutation before being XORed with the left half.
  This swapping and mixing ensures that the effect of a single bit in the plaintext will be spread over multiple bits in the ciphertext.
Diffusion Demonstration:
  Suppose you change one bit of the plaintext (e.g., the first bit changes from 0 to 1).
  After one round of DES processing, this change will affect many bits of the resulting ciphertext.
  This is due to the permutation and mixing steps that ensure the bit change is diffused throughout the output.


Confusion:

Assume a simplified DES where we only use one round and one S-box.
Suppose the 6-bit input to the S-box is 100011.
The S-box table might output 1010 after substitution.

Diffusion:

Let's see how diffusion spreads changes:

Initial Plaintext: 01101100 10110011 (Binary for simplicity)
Initial Permutation (IP): Suppose it permutes to 11001100 01101100.
Round Function:
Expansion, XOR with key, substitution, and permutation lead to mixed data.
Final Permutation (FP): The output after the final permutation ensures that changes to the input data affect many bits in the final ciphertext.
By applying these processes iteratively across multiple rounds, DES achieves robust confusion and diffusion, making cryptanalysis significantly more challenging.


Confusion and diffusion are key properties in DES that together ensure the security of the encryption process. Confusion obscures the relationship between the key and the ciphertext, while diffusion spreads the influence of plaintext bits throughout the ciphertext. Both are essential in protecting against various cryptographic attacks and ensuring the integrity of encrypted data.
