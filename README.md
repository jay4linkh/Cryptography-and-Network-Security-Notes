# Cryptography and Network Security Notes

This repository contains comprehensive lecture notes for the Cryptography and Network Security.
## Description

This repository is dedicated to providing detailed and well-organized lecture notes for the "Cryptography and Network Security" course. Each lecture note is designed to help students understand fundamental concepts and practical implementations essential for understanding a particular topic.

### Lecture Notes

The lecture notes are structured to cover the following topics:

1. **Introduction of Data Encryption**
